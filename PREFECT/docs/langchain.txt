LangChain is an open-source orchestration framework designed to simplify the building of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and components to connect LLMs with external data sources, APIs, and computational resources, enabling developers to create complex, multi-step AI workflows. Key ConceptsThe framework is based on the idea of "chaining" different components together to create a cohesive workflow. Chains: A sequence of actions or calls (to an LLM, a tool, or a data processing step) where the output of one step serves as the input for the next.Prompt Templates: Pre-built structures that help formalize and manage the prompts sent to AI models, making prompt engineering more efficient and reusable.Memory: Modules that allow applications to store and retrieve past conversation history, providing context for subsequent interactions and enabling stateful chatbots.Agents: An agent uses an LLM as a reasoning engine to autonomously decide which sequence of actions or "tools" to take to accomplish a goal, rather than following a hardcoded sequence.Tools: Functions or APIs that agents can call to interact with external systems, such as Google Search, Wolfram Alpha, or custom internal databases, to access real-time or domain-specific information.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A core use case for LangChain that involves retrieving relevant information from external documents or databases (like vector stores) to augment the LLM's knowledge and improve the accuracy of its responses.
